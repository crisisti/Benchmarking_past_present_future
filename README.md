# Benchmarking_past_present_future
<h1>Workshop Home Page for Benchmarking: Past, Present and Future</h1>

Where have we been, and where are we going?  We have an amazing collection of invited speakers that can share with us first hand knowledge of how benchmarking became important in Information Retrieval, and then in speech (starting around 1975), and then in language (in 1988).  Much of this history is described in this video and two 2016 Interspeech keynotes: Makhoul describes how benchmarking overcame resistance in speech in this keynote, and Jurafsky describes how this approach moved from speech to language in this keynote.

It is easier to talk about the past than the future.  These days, benchmarks evolve more bottom up (such as papers with code).  There used to be more top-down leadership from government (and industry, in the case of systems, with benchmarks such as SPEC).  Going forward, there may be more top-down leadership from organizations like MLPerf and/or influencers like David Ferrucci, who was responsible for IBMâ€™s success with Jeopardy, and has recently written a paper suggesting how the community should think about benchmarking for machine comprehension (To Test Machine Comprehension, Start by Defining Comprehension).  Tasks such as reading comprehension become even more interesting as we move beyond English.  Multilinguality introduces many challenges, and even more opportunities.

<h2>Invited Speakers</h2> 

We have an amazing collection of invited talks, many with direct first-hand knowledge of this history, and many insights for the future.

In addition to invited talks, there will be a call for submitted papers on benchmarking.  It is expected that invited speakers and submitted papers will address the following central questions:
<ol>
<li>What important technologies and underlying sciences need to be fostered, now and in the future?</li>
<li>In each case, are there existing tasks/benchmarks that move the field in the right direction?</li>
<li>Where are there gaps?</li>
<li>For the gaps, are there initial steps that are accessible, attractive, and cost effective?</li>
<li>How large should a benchmark be?  
  <ol>
<li>How much data do we need to measure significant differences?  </li>
<li>How much data do machines need to obtain good performance?  </li>
<li>How much data do babies need to learn language? </li>
  </ol> </li>
